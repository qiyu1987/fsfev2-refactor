# SCREAMING BACK ECHO BOT

This is a Learning Practice of refactoring.
The bot scream back what you type in ALL CAPS with a question mark.

## Original repo

[Frontend Masters: Full Stack for Front-End Engineers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-v2/chat-bot-exercise/) By Jem Young, [original repo](https://github.com/young/fsfev2)

## Motivation

Jem did an amazing introductory course covering wide rang of topics. However I found the last bit of chat bot challenge quite difficult.

I have also been reading recently [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) by Uncle Bob, so I decide to give the code a make over to understand it better. It mostly break down Jem's original code into functions with less than 2 level of nesting (except for the try catch block).

## Run

- clone or download repo
- run `yarn install`
- start dev server `yarn dev`
